<p>Ah, Friday! A day to kick back, relax, and savor a well-earned cocktail after a long week. There's no better way to start your weekend than with a classic Dry Martini, followed by some delicious bruschettas.</p>
<h2 id="the-dry-martini-a-timeless-friday-classic">The Dry Martini: A Timeless Friday Classic</h2>
<p>The Dry Martini is a sophisticated and elegant cocktail that never goes out of style. With just two main ingredients, gin (or vodka) and vermouth, this simple yet refined drink allows the flavors of the spirits to shine through.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>60 ml (2 oz) gin or vodka</li>
<li>5-10 ml (1/3 - 2/3 oz) dry vermouth</li>
<li>Ice</li>
<li>Olives or lemon twist, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Fill a mixing glass with ice.</li>
<li>Add the gin (or vodka) and vermouth to the mixing glass. For an extra dry Martini, use the lower end of the vermouth range (5 ml or 1/3 oz).</li>
<li>Stir the mixture for about 30 seconds, or until well chilled.</li>
<li>Strain the cocktail into a chilled Martini glass.</li>
<li>Garnish with olives or a lemon twist and enjoy your Friday classic.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's no secret that Sir Winston Churchill enjoyed a Dry Martini or two, but rumor has it that he took &quot;dry&quot; to a whole new level. When it came to vermouth, he believed that simply offering a grateful bow in the direction of Paris was more than sufficient. So the next time you mix up a Dry Martini, just remember: if it's good enough for Churchill, a courteous nod towards France might be all the vermouth you need!</p>
<h2 id="tasty-bruschettas">Tasty Bruschettas</h2>
<p>Now that you've got your Dry Martini in hand, let's move on to some appetizing bruschettas. Try sourdough, ciabatta, or a crusty whole grain baguette to create the perfect base for your bruschettas.</p>
<h2 id="classic-tomato-bruschetta">Classic Tomato Bruschetta</h2>

<li>1/4 cup (60 ml) extra virgin olive oil</li>

<li>Fresh basil, chopped, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven's broiler or grill.</li>
<li>Place the slices of bread on a baking sheet and broil/grill them for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden and crispy. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning.</li>
<li>Rub one side of each toasted bread slice with a garlic clove.</li>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven's broiler or grill.</li>
<li>Place the slices of bread on a baking sheet and broil/grill them for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden and crispy. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning</li>
<li>Spread an even layer of ricotta cheese on each toasted bread slice.</li>
<li>Top the ricotta with two slices of prosciutto per bruschetta.</li>
<li>Arrange the fig quarters on top of the prosciutto.</li>
<li>Lightly drizzle each bruschetta with honey and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="wine-pairings-for-bruschettas">Wine Pairings for Bruschettas</h2>
<p>For the Classic Tomato Bruschetta, a crisp, refreshing white wine such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc would complement the flavors beautifully. These wines have zesty acidity and bright citrus notes that will enhance the taste of the tomatoes and basil.</p>
<p>For the Ricotta, Prosciutto, and Fig Bruschetta, a light-bodied red wine like a Pinot Noir or a fruity ros√© would be an excellent choice. The fruit-forward profile and subtle earthiness of these wines will harmonize with the sweet figs and savory prosciutto.</p>
<p>Raise a glass to a delightful Friday evening with a Dry Martini in hand and delicious bruschettas on the table. Cheers to the weekend!</p>
