<p>Welcome to another installment of Grape Escapes, where we explore the world one grape at a time. Today, we‚Äôre heading to the sun-soaked region of Puglia in southern Italy, the homeland of the Negroamaro grape.</p>
<h2 id="the-negroamaro-grape">The Negroamaro Grape</h2>
<p>Negroamaro is a dark-skinned grape variety that has been associated with the Puglia region in southern Italy for at least 1,500 years. Most commonly found in the Salento peninsula (the heel of Italy's boot), it is the pillar of the region's red wine production and is used both in blend and varietal wines.</p>
<p>The name 'Negroamaro' translates roughly to 'black bitter' in English, reflecting the grape's distinctive color and the slightly bitter notes it can contribute to wines. Despite its name, the wines made from Negroamaro are often characterized by a balance of fruitiness and bitterness, creating a harmonious taste experience.</p>
<p>Negroamaro is the second most planted grape in Puglia and ranks among the top 15 of Italy's most cultivated grape varieties. Its resilience to heat and drought conditions, combined with its prolific yields, makes it a favored choice for many local winemakers.</p>
<p>Wines made from Negroamaro, like the Calafuria Rosato, typically exhibit a deep ruby color and are known for their full-bodied and robust nature. Aromas and flavors may range from ripe dark fruits to spicy, earthy notes, often accompanied by a hint of tobacco or dark chocolate.</p>
<p>Despite its prevalence in Puglia, Negroamaro is not widely grown outside the region, making these wines a unique expression of the Italian South. They offer excellent value and are typically approachable in their youth while being capable of aging beautifully.</p>
<h2 id="wine-pairing">Wine Pairing</h2>
<p>Negroamaro wines are versatile when it comes to food pairing. Their bold flavors and high acidity make them an excellent match for rich, meaty dishes. Pair a Negroamaro with hearty Italian fare like lasagna or osso buco, or even a juicy grilled steak.</p>
