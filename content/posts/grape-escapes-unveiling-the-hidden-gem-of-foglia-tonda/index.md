<p>As we open another chapter in our beloved "Grape Escapes" series, it's a joy to take you off the beaten path, immersing ourselves in the lesser-known delights of the wine world. Today, we're uncovering the hidden gem of Tuscany – Foglia Tonda. An ancient, indigenous grape variety that is rediscovering its fame in the 21st century. Let's dive in!</p><h2 id="a-journey-back-in-time-the-historical-roots-of-foglia-tonda"><strong>A Journey Back in Time: The Historical Roots of Foglia Tonda</strong></h2><p>The story of Foglia Tonda takes us back to the medieval times of Italy, a land that has always been a cradle of ancient grape varieties. A grape that can trace its history back centuries, Foglia Tonda was referenced in writings dating back to the 1880s and was once known as a popular variety used in traditional Tuscan blends.</p><p>Regrettably, Foglia Tonda almost disappeared after the phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century and, with the rise of more internationally recognized grapes like Cabernet and Merlot in the 20th century, it fell further into obscurity. This neglected grape lay dormant, forgotten until the 21st century, when the quest for the revival of indigenous grape varieties began to take flight.</p><h2 id="a-revival-worth-noticing-the-renaissance-of-foglia-tonda"><strong>A Revival Worth Noticing: The Renaissance of Foglia Tonda</strong></h2><p>At the beginning of the 21st century, in the rolling vineyards of Tuscany, winemakers embarked on the journey to reclaim their vinicultural heritage. Amid the expanse of Sangiovese vineyards, an old grape began to experience a new dawn - Foglia Tonda. This revival was spearheaded by a few innovative winemakers dedicated to exploring the potential of under-appreciated local varietals, Foglia Tonda being one of them.</p><p>The grape’s name, Foglia Tonda, translates as "round leaf" - an accurate description reflecting the round shape of the leaves of the vine. The grape is small and dark-skinned, capable of producing wines with deep color, abundant tannins, and a unique flavor profile.</p><h2 id="the-flavor-profile-what-to-expect-from-foglia-tonda"><strong>The Flavor Profile: What to Expect from Foglia Tonda</strong></h2><p>Wines made from Foglia Tonda are often deep ruby red and are typically rich in tannins and acidity - attributes that make it an excellent candidate for ageing. The wine expresses a medium-bodied character with an intriguingly spicy flavor profile, underpinned by subtle notes of ripe red fruits like cherries and red currants. Hints of dried herbs and a whisper of tobacco and leather are also common, contributing to an overall complex and layered taste.</p><h2 id="pairing-foglia-tonda-an-oenophiles-delight"><strong>Pairing Foglia Tonda: An Oenophile's Delight</strong></h2><p>When it comes to food pairings, Foglia Tonda's full-bodied nature and firm tannin structure make it a perfect accompaniment to hearty Tuscan dishes. Try pairing it with a robust 'Bistecca alla Fiorentina', or perhaps a rich game dish like 'Pappardelle al Cinghiale'. Its characteristic acidity and pronounced tannins cut through the richness of these dishes, while its complex flavors provide a harmonious counterpoint to the robustness of the Tuscan cuisine.</p><h2 id="exploring-foglia-tonda-journey-begins"><strong>Exploring Foglia Tonda: Journey Begins</strong></h2><p>Exploring Foglia Tonda can feel like uncovering a part of history that had almost been lost. This ancient grape, with its vibrant flavors and exciting potential, is an example of the treasure trove that is Italy's indigenous grape varieties. The revival of Foglia Tonda is more than just the resurgence of an old grape - it's a testament to the resilience and strength of tradition. It stands as a symbol for the importance of preserving biodiversity, honoring our past, and continually striving for excellence in the world of wine.</p><p>On your next visit to the wine shop or while browsing an online wine catalogue, keep an eye out for Foglia Tonda. Enjoy it, savor it, and be part of the movement that's bringing back these amazing, lesser-known grapes to the world's attention. After all, every grape has a story to tell. Are you ready to listen?</p><hr><p>Remember, the world of wine is vast and full of mystery. Never hesitate to venture off the familiar path - you never know what hidden gems you might find. Cheers to the next Grape Escape!</p>
